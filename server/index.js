// Server proxy previously included reCAPTCHA verification and forwarding logic.
// Per the project maintainer's request, that logic was removed and this file
// is now a placeholder. The client application posts directly to Formspree
// (https://formspree.io/f/xzzjzjky). If you want a server-side proxy again,
// re-add an implementation that verifies tokens server-side and forwards the
// submission to Formspree. Do NOT store secrets in source control.

// Placeholder to indicate removal â€” no runtime behavior.
